## Learn NLP from scratch again

<!-- After learning some basic concepts and knowledge about NLP, using tools like Pytorch, AllenNLP, Jieba tokenizer, following course like DeepLearning and CS224n, writting networks, reading papers about SOTA/classic theory, applying model on real world tasks, I still can't have an overall insigt in NLP. I have to admit that I didn't get professional training and systematic education about NLP(although I major in SE).     -->

&emsp;&emsp;Here is why I started this project: **learn NLP from scratch again**. I choose [Speech and language process](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) as my entry point, and try to write solutions and implement some algorithms/models of this book. I hope I can stick to this project and update frequently.:smile:

git clone git@github.com:ZacBi/learn_NLP_again.git
cd ./learn_NLP_again
pip install -r ./requirements_dev.txt
pip install -e ./ --no-binary :all:
```

pytest:
